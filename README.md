# UW Impact Content Management System
A simple one-page CMS application for student group websites provided by the UW Impact. 

## Background
I founded UW Impact, a student club at University of Winnipeg, in 2020 with an aim to promote a collaborative learning platform for tech-enthusiast students. When all campus activities moved online due to COVID-19, I started a project in 2020 to provide free websites to UofW student clubs. In December 2020, I created this simple CMS application to make the web services project more accessible to the student groups as it enables them to manage the content of their website easily by themslves. The application has since been used by 10+ student clubs at UWinnipeg.
